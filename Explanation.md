##
1:This code is a React functional component that implements a login form with email and password fields, as well as an OTP (One-Time Password) verification step. Here's an explanation of the code:

2:Import statements: The code imports necessary libraries and modules, including React, useState, useForm, zod, zodResolver, axios, and OTPInput.

3:Type declarations: The code defines a type formData that represents the shape of the form data (email and password).

4:LoginForm component: The main component is LoginForm, which renders the login form.

5:Local state: The component uses useState to manage local state, including form values, OTP input, and OTP verification status.

6:Zod schema: The code defines a Zod schema to validate the form data before submission. The schema checks if the email is in a valid format and if the password is between 5 and 12 characters long.

6.1:In this example, we define a Zod schema with validation rules for the username, email, password, and confirmPassword fields. We then use zodResolver to convert this schema into a resolver function, which we pass to the resolver option when calling useForm. This ensures that the validation rules defined in the Zod schema are enforced by React Hook Form.


6.2:useForm hook: The component uses the useForm hook from the react-hook-form library to handle form state and validation. The hook is configured with the Zod schema using zodResolver.

7:submitData function: This function is called when the form is submitted. It sends a POST request to the specified API endpoint with the form data. If the API returns an OTP reference, the component sets the OTP verification state to true.

8:handleOtpSubmit function: This function is called when the OTP form is submitted. It sends a POST request to the specified API endpoint with the OTP and OTP reference. If the API returns a successful response, the component sets the token in local storage and displays an alert.

9:JSX: The component renders a form with email and password fields if OTP verification is not required. If OTP verification is required, it renders an OTP input field instead. The component also displays validation errors and handles form submission.

10:Export: The component is exported as the default export.
